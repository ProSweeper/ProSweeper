Hi! My name is Dylan and I am a Full-Stack Software Developer. I enjoy learning and using technologies to make a difference in mine and others days. Recently, I graduated from General Assembly and am now looking to land my first software engineering role. I am a JavaScript developer with plenty of experience with the MERN stack, who also has experience with python and django. I have a passion for programming and the problem solving aspect that accompanies it. With the ever evolving landscape in the technology world I am excited to keep learning and finding new problems to solve

It is my long term goal to be able to launch a learning platform for coding and I am beyond excited to take the next step in that journey. I feel it is important to provide a platform to learn coding because where I am from not enough people know how accessible coding can be and I want to help people be able to support themselves and their family in these increasingly difficult times.

When I am not coding or studying programming I enjoy playing and watching hockey, playing video games, and working out. I am also a big sci-fi and fantasy nerd who enjoys going outdoors to camp/hike.
